# Framework for the Reservoir Compiler

Working towards a compiler to express high-level code in RNNs. Currently building a framework for programming RNNs based on [Jason Kim's method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00668-8).

Documentation for this project can be found [here](https://breezy-femur-f21.notion.site/PRNN-Language-10da7df1d2198026ae14fbd7b9af2a6e).
