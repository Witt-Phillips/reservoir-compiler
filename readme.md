Working towards a compiler to express high-level code in RNNs. Currently building a framework for programming RNNs based on Jason [Kim's method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00668-8).

## Quick Start

Welcome to the framework for the reservoir compiler. If you do stuff like this a lot, just clone, set up a venv, install dependencies @ `requirements.txt`, and ensure you have Matlab installed & licensend. Then feel free to skip to examples.

### Basics

If not, all good! These commands accomplish what I just described.

```{bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/Witt-Phillips/reservoir-compiler
$ python -m venv venv
$ source myenv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Matlab

The current version of this framework uses the Matlab engine, but requires that you have Matlab installed on your machine and that you have an active license.
